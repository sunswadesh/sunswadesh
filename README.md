- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Swadesh. I do not know much, but I am always eager to learn. I will be archiving and maintaining the codes that I have written for simulations and data analysis here. I have developed codes for antenna simulations in an space envorinment, modeled the effects that the disturbed ionosphere can have on GNSS signals, and plasma behaviour.
- ðŸ“« I love talking about research and actively seek out people to collaborate. If you have any questions about my work or would like to colloborate please send me an email at: swadeshp@gmail.com
